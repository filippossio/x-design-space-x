# Tech Test

Your task is to create a React application that will consume data from the SpaceX public API. The application must retrieve historic and future SpaceX launches and present them in a list view.
Provided in this pack are a copy of the designs as well as all of the assets you will need. Use the create-react-app CLI tool to generate a new react project and feel free to use any 3rd party packages that will assist in your development.

Designs are available from: [https://sketch.cloud/s/yyv1b/agmoaZP](https://sketch.cloud/s/yyv1b/agmoaZP)

The API documentation is available from:
Postman - [https://docs.spacexdata.com](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)
GitHub - [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

Stories:

- As a user, I want the ability to load the full list of SpaceX launches from the SpaceX API
- As a user, I want the ability to reload the data to see any new changes
- As a user, I want the ability to filter the launch list by year
- As a user, I want the ability to sort all launches by date (ascending/descending)

Considerations we will be looking for in your submission are:

- Project approach
- Accuracy of designs
- State management
- Code quality
- Network logic

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
